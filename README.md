Welcome to my Handwriting Recognition app. This Optical Character Recognition app uses Machine learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten characters.
The app may be incompatible with modern smartphones arm64 as this was developed for x86_64 legacy android phones.
The CNN model is in Fully_connected_NN_Project.ipynb.
